# Home Assistant is an open source home automation tool. I'm not exactly sure how I'm
# going to use it, but I think I'll probably find some interesting ways. Mostly, I'm 
# future-proofing; when I get a permanent place, I want to slowly add things to make 
# a privacy-focused smart home. I figure learning how to do it now will help later on.

# 
# Regarding integrations, I know of a few that I want to start with:
#  - Google Home: As much as I hate my Google Home, we'd use it if we had this.
#  - Roku: Would love the ability to put things on using the Google Home.
#  - Lights: Eventually, will get smart + color controlled bulbs.
#  - ECOVACS: My stupid robot vacuum might be cool to use with the app.
# 
# Potential future integrations:
#  - Heat/air conditioning: Controlling the thermostat would be killer!
#  - Wall-mounted tablets: Score an old iPad and use it for home control, I think so.
#  - Cameras: Will eventually get cameras for the outside of our home.
#  - Solar/power metrics: I want solar panels *for sure*.
#  - Water metrics: Tracking this stuff might be neat, who knows.
