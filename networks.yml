# docker-socket-proxy lets you set permissions such that any container that
# needs to use the docker socket doesn't have too much power. A container
# that has unrestricted docker socket access poses a security risk. For
# example, Watchtower, Portainer, Traefik, and Homarr all use the docker
# socket.

# The synobridge network is used for freeing up ports and network
