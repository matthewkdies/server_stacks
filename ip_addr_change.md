> I have a Synology router and NAS that run on the `192.168.1.XXX` address space. It works, except when I travel and try to use VPN, as the address space clashes with the local networks elsewhere. What would be a good address space to use instead, and what would be the steps to changing it?

The issue you're experiencing stems from the fact that many local networks, including those in hotels, coffee shops, or even some public spaces, may also use the `192.168.x.x` address range. This causes a conflict when you connect to your Synology router or NAS via VPN while you're on another network that also uses the same range.

To resolve this, you can change your local network address space to a different private IP address range that doesn't overlap with the common ones used in public or other local networks. The most widely used private IP address ranges are:

1. **10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255** (Class A)
2. **172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255** (Class B)
3. **192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255** (Class C, which you're currently using)

Since you're already using `192.168.1.x`, I recommend changing your address space to one of the other ranges, such as `10.0.0.0/24` or `172.16.0.0/24`, as these are less likely to overlap with common networks.

### Recommended Address Space: `10.0.0.0/24`

This range is relatively rare in consumer networks and should minimize the chances of conflict with most public networks.

### Steps to Change the Address Space

#### 1. **Log into Your Synology Router**
   - Open a browser and go to your router's IP address (likely `192.168.1.1`).
   - Log in with your administrator credentials.

#### 2. **Change the LAN IP Range**
   - In the router settings, go to **Network** or **LAN settings**.
   - Look for the **LAN IP** or **IP Address** field and change the address from `192.168.1.1` to something in the `10.0.0.x` range, such as `10.0.0.1`.
   - Set the **Subnet Mask** to `255.255.255.0`, which will create a network range of `10.0.0.1` to `10.0.0.254`.

#### 3. **Update Your DHCP Settings**
   - In the **DHCP Settings** section (also under Network or LAN settings), change the **DHCP range** to match the new subnet. For example, set it from `10.0.0.100` to `10.0.0.199`, which will assign IPs within this range.
   - Ensure that the router's static IP (`10.0.0.1`) is outside this range to avoid conflicts.

#### 4. **Reconfigure Your NAS**
   - Your NAS (Synology) will likely be set with a static IP in the `192.168.1.x` range.
   - You will need to log into the Synology NAS (either via its web interface or through DSM) and update its network settings:
     - Set the NAS's IP address to something within the new `10.0.0.x` range (e.g., `10.0.0.2`).
     - Update any DNS settings if necessary, though it will typically use the router as the DNS server.

#### 5. **Update VPN Settings (if applicable)**
   - If your Synology VPN server is configured to route specific IP addresses or subnets, ensure that the VPN server settings are updated to reflect the new `10.0.0.x` network.
   - This might involve adjusting the routing tables on your router and VPN configurations.

#### 6. **Test Connectivity**
   - After making the changes, reconnect your devices to the local network and verify that they are receiving IP addresses from the new `10.0.0.x` range.
   - Test VPN functionality from an external network to ensure the address space change resolves the conflict.

### Advantages of Using `10.0.0.x`:
- **Less Overlap:** It's less common in public networks, reducing the likelihood of IP conflicts when traveling.
- **Future-Proofing:** It's part of a larger address space, offering more flexibility for larger networks or multiple subnets in the future.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **VPN Access:** If you're still having issues accessing your Synology devices remotely through VPN after the change, ensure that the correct routes are set up on both your Synology router and VPN server.
- **DNS Conflicts:** Make sure your DNS settings are updated correctly, especially if you're using your Synology router's DNS server.

Changing to the `10.0.0.x` range should resolve your VPN connection issues while traveling and avoid conflicts with local networks.
