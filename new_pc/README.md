After discussion with the very persuasive nerds (positive) that I work with, it's probably time that I build my own PC.
This directory contains a hodgepodge of files with information about the whole process.
At the moment, the `pc_build.md` just contains a conversation I had with ChatGPT about the process.
The `pc_todo.md` contains things I will have to do to complete the process (aside from building the actual PC, obviously).
This includes hardware to purchase, security updates, Docker management tasks, and more.
